## 🔑 Key Technical Implementations

### 1. Positive Response Generation
```python
def _generate_positive_response(self, user_answer: str) -> str:
    prompt = f"""Generate a brief, encouraging response to this interview answer...
    Keep it natural, positive, and under 20 words."""
    
    response = self.llm.invoke([{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])
    return response.content.strip()
```

### 2. Skip Detection
```python
if user_answer.lower().strip() in ['skip', 'next', 'pass']:
    positive_response = "No problem! Let's move on to the next question."
    # Continue with next question logic
```

### 3. Session State Management
```python
if 'interview_system' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.interview_system = InteractiveInterviewSystem()
if 'conversation_history' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.conversation_history = []
